## Step 1: Remove the Dockerfile from Git's tracking
Open your terminal or command line interface.

Run this command to remove the Dockerfile from Git's tracking but keep it in your local directory:

```
git rm --cached Synergy.PreseaCadet.Api/Dockerfile
```
git rm --cached removes the file from Git's tracking, but the file will still exist in your local folder.

After running the above command, commit the change:

```
git commit -m "Stop tracking Synergy.PreseaCadet.Api/Dockerfile"
```
This creates a commit that tells Git to stop tracking the Dockerfile.

## Step 2: Add the Dockerfile to .gitignore
To make sure Git ignores the Dockerfile in the future, you need to add it to the .gitignore file.

Open the .gitignore file (if it exists) in your project directory. If you don't have one, create it.

Add the path to the Dockerfile to .gitignore. You can do this by running:

```
echo "Synergy.PreseaCadet.Api/Dockerfile" >> .gitignore
```
This will add the Dockerfile path to the .gitignore file so that Git ignores it in future commits.

Commit the changes to .gitignore:

```
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add Dockerfile to .gitignore"
```
This ensures that the .gitignore file is updated and Git will ignore the Dockerfile moving forward.

## Step 3: Push the changes to your repository
Now, push these changes to your remote repository.

Push your changes:

```
git push origin your-branch
```
Replace your-branch with the name of the branch you are working on (e.g., dev or feature-branch).

## Step 4: Verify that the Dockerfile is no longer tracked
After pushing the changes, you should verify that the Dockerfile is no longer in the repository.

Check if the Dockerfile is removed:
```
On GitHub: Go to your repository's branch and check if the Dockerfile still exists.
Locally: Run git status in your terminal. It should show no changes related to the Dockerfile.
```

## Step 5: Merge dev into qa without the Dockerfile
After completing the above steps, you can now safely merge the dev branch into the qa branch without the Dockerfile being included.

To merge, run:

```
git checkout qa
git merge dev
Push the merged changes to your remote repository:
```

git push origin qa
Now, the Dockerfile should no longer be part of your repository or merged into any other branches, including qa.
